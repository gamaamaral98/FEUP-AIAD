## Agent-based money distribution for ATM’s solution

ATMs sure make everyone's life easier, if you need money, you go to an ATM
and withdraw the amount of money you wish within your account regime limitations.
Sometimes, ATMs run out of money, which can be an annoying problem since the
person can’t withdraw, forcing a bank worker to refill the machine. With this project
our objective is to reduce the cost of refilling a machine by the workers by studying
the rate of money withdrawals and thus preventing that a machine runs out of
money.
